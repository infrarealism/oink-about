<p>Are you tired of the clumsiness of handling raw and high resolution photos?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you prefer not to use your high-end camera for being too complicated to load images from there into your computer and then share them on social media? All this when you could do it directly from your iPhone on one single step?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oink tries to leverage that pain and make it more seamlessly, it is not as smooth yet, might get closer some day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This app doesn't provide any professional tool for editing or retouching your photos, this app is in fact quite simple and small, but it might help you browse through all your photo folders quickly and export the photo you need super fast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Specially useful if you want to avoid adding your images to iCloud or any other server based account. Oink won't remember any of your images and won't add any of them to iCloud.</p>
