<h1>Oink</h1>
<p>Are you tired of the clumsiness of handling raw and high resolution photos?</p>
<p>I know I am, that is why I created this app and I'm sharing it now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does it happened to you that you prefer not to use your high end camera because it is so complicated to load the images from there into your computer and then to export those image and share them on social media? All this when you could do it directly from your iPhone on one single step?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Oink I try to leverage that and make it more seamlessly, it is not as smooth yet, might get closer some day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This app doesn't provide any professional tool for editing or retouching your photos, this app is in fact quite simple and small, but it might help you browse through all your photo folders quickly and export the photo you need super fast.</p>
